This is an initial document for all the theory which I'm learning. It's a second version for this document. First one can be found at https://github.com/GeekchanskiY/THEORY. I want to make all this data more structured, which will allow me to create a set of supportive tools for different purposes (pet projects, actually). All of the tolls can be found at https://github.com/GeekchanskiY/obsidian_go. 


Structure of document:

1 - Title, which is necessary for obsidian document structure.
2 - short intro of the document. I want to make less documents, and make them contain more information.
3 - blocks with content, which will be started with `##`
 3.1 - Title
 3.2 - info, sub-topics can be divided with `###`
 3.3 - sub-topic 'Questions'
  3.3.1 - question with correct and incorrect answers, with a specific format:
  `Question: text \n correct_answer: text \n incorrect_answer: text`
